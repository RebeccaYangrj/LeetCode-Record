similar to find the depth, every time find a node depth we can get the diameter of the node: diameter = right + left
we can store the diameter in a list 
after run the recursion we can use the max(list) to find our final results

inside a function, when we have to build anothe function we should use other variable name

we can not use the variable directly 
when we use this function we can input the overall variable instead.
